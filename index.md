# Welcome!

Gardening chat is intended for the discussion of gardening, farming, and growing plants in general. We mostly focus on growing for consumption but we're quite open to discussion about decorative gardening as well.

Both green thumbs and brown thumbs are welcome here!

# Expected conduct

Discussion about restricted plants (eg, marijuana) is allowed but we strongly prefer that discussions stick to the growing of the plant, not the processing or consumption of it.

Discussions about unrelated politics should be left at the door. We make some allowance for where politics are relevant to gardening and farming, but this community is not the place for general political discourse.

Our community is a blend of people with means who grow for income or hobby and people who grow out of necessity. We expect that all participants be respectful and kind to one another. We expect that people will listen to the requests of everyone in the channel, not just the ops/moderators. If anyone indicates they are uncomfortable with a particular discussion then we expect everyone else to respect that and move on.

Participants who are engaging in bad faith interactions will be asked to leave at the sole discretion of the ops/moderators. Examples of bad faith interactions include but are not limited to:

* Bigotry such as pejoratives, slurs, persecution or chauvinism based on race, faith, culture, language, place origin, place of residence, sex, sexuality, gender, gender identity, employment, ability or socio-economic status. This includes both genuine sentiment and "jokes". Religion, culture and political beliefs are not valid excuses for engaging in these.
* Aggressive and hostile actions such as name-calling, insults, trolling/baiting/taunting people with intent of causing their exclusion, bringing outside disputes into the community or other harassing attention.
* Disruptive content such as NSFW links, repeatedly talking nonsense, constantly causing offtopic discussion, flooding.

Ban duration will be at the sole discretion of the ops/moderators. Repeat offenses and ban evasion will severely extend the length of a ban.

Please do not publish logs publically or bring in noisy bots or client scripts without the consent of the ops/moderators.
