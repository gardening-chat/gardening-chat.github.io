# About us

Welcome to the gardening chat community!

Gardening chat is intended for the discussion of gardening, farming, and growing plants in general. We mostly focus on growing for consumption but we're quite open to discussion about decorative gardening as well.

Both green thumbs and brown thumbs are welcome here!
