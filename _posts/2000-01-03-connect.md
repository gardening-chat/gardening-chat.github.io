### You can join the community by:
- **connecting to the [Libera Chat](https://libera.chat) IRC network and
joining [##gardening (webchat link)](https://web.libera.chat/##gardening)**
- **joining via Matrix, we're listed as `##gardening:libera.chat`**

Sometimes the channel might require you to have a Libera.Chat account to talk.
This is to prevent abuse and spam. If you don't have one, learn
[how to register](https://libera.chat/guides/registration).

When connecting with Matrix it is often not clear if your messages are
visible to IRC users. If you are not logged in to a Libera.Chat account you
will need to direct message `@NickServ:libera.chat` to register or identify.
Documentation is available [on Libera.Chat's website](https://libera.chat/guides/faq#can-i-connect-with-matrix)
and [in the bridge documentation](https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-appservice-irc/).
