You can join the community by: 
- connecting to the [Libera Chat](https://libera.chat) irc network and
[joining the ##gardening channel (webchat link)](https://web.libera.chat/##gardening)
- joining via Matrix, we're listed as `##gardening:libera.chat`

Sometimes the channel might require you to have a Libera.Chat account to talk.
This is to prevent abuse and spam. If you don't have one, learn
[how to register](https://libera.chat/guides/registration). If you're
accessing the channel via Matrix, then you'll need to direct message
`@NickServ:libera.chat` with "help register" or "help identify". More
documentation is available [on Libera.Chat's website](https://libera.chat/guides/faq#can-i-connect-with-matrix)
and [in the bridge documentation](https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-appservice-irc/).
